# Hashtables
Implement a Hashtable

## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable with the methods add, get, contains and hash methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
* add
    * Big O speace O(1)
    * Big O time O(1)
* get
    * Big O speace O(1)
    * Big O time O(1)
* contains
    * Big O speace O(1)
    * Big O time O(1)
* hash
    * Big O speace O(1)
    * Big O time O(1)

## API
* add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
* get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
* contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
* hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.
